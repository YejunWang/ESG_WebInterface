# dbESG: A Database Curating the Evolution of Salmonella Genomes

**dbESG** is a specialized database initiated to dynamically illustrate the genome evolution of the *Salmonella* genus. By tracing ancient orthologous chromosomes across species, subspecies, and major phylogenetic nodes, dbESG delineates evolutionary trajectories to facilitate a deeper understanding of how genome evolution influences molecular and biological phenotypes.

## 🧬 Biological Context

*Salmonella* diverged from *Escherichia* approximately 100 million years ago, subsequently evolving into two distinct species: *S. enterica* and *S. bongori*.

* **Diversity:** *S. enterica* has further diversified into 7+ subspecies and over 2,000 serovars.
* **Host Adaptability:** The genus includes generalists with broad host ranges (e.g., *S. typhimurium*, *S. enteritidis*) which cause self-limited Non-Typhoidal Salmonellae diseases, and specialists (e.g., *S. typhi*, *S. paratyphi A*) which cause invasive infections.
* **Phenotypes:** Beyond host adaptability, serovars vary extensively in phenotypes such as invasion, persistence, and antibiotic resistance.

## 🚀 Key Features
